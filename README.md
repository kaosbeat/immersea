# immersea
openNI 2.2 arm has some piculiarities...
it wil only run when in the lib folder... some static linking issue I presume

## using
python3 !!!!
pip3 install opencv-contrib-python
pip3 install primesense


## calibration
a new space can be calibrated using depthcalibrate.py
parameters can be tweaked and tested with testbackimng.py, given the correct calibration files from the previous step


## run production
the production file is called immersea.py
run it...
